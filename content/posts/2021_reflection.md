Hello there.
This post is all about my introspection to how the last year went so that I can take the good things and learn from my  mistakes, hence try to improve the upcoming year.

## What went well this year?

- I spent the entire year working from my hometown, Siliguri. 
Many of my school friends had also come home. 
Met them after a very long time. 
Remembered and cherished the good old times.

- Staying at home also means good food cooked by mom. 
Enjoyed the delicacies cooked by mom throughout the year.

- We celebrated all festivals of the year as well as each family member’s birthday at home. 
It was so great enjoying these moments with family after a long time. 
So many festivals throughout the calendar: Holi, Rakhi, Durga Puja, Diwali, Chhath, Christmas and finally New Year.

- I had purchased a Table Tennis table last year. It was great playing TT be it the singles format or the doubles. 
I had some real adrenaline rush in a few speed and intense matches.

- Owing to Corona and lockdown, though I could not make many big trips but definitely enjoyed weekend road trips to the hills and the forest. 
Explored new places and valleys.
Drove my bike in the hills of Darjeeling. 
It was a thrilling experience taking turns on the curves.
Spirit soars where the air goes thin.

- Me and my college friends went for one big trip to the North East. 
The place brought with it something new and we enjoyed the beauty. Meeting them after almost 2 years was fabulous.

- I had my cousin sister’s wedding in April. 
Shared my birthday with the Mehendi ceremony of di. 
Marriage was done with a great setting at Courtyard by Marriott taking all covid precautions. 
Our attire matched well with the hall decorations. 
It was a beautiful night.

- After a year and a half of working at Dunzo, I switched to Nutanix. 
I like what I am building and get to learn a lot from the people here. 
I have improved my skills in Golang and also have tried my hands on containerization tools, i.e, Docker, K8s. 
I also became familiar with GCP, all thanks to the projects which I have been working on here.

- Voted for the first time at the age of 25 in the West Bengal Legislative Assembly Election. 
I know that it’s very sad that I didn’t vote for so long, but better late than never.

## What didn’t go so well this year?

Not everything goes right in life. 
There are moments which we do not like but are bound to come and we need to cope and learn from them.

- Had to read several rejection mails before getting the right offer. 
Everytime I felt that I made it but then got a negative response.

- Good part of staying at home was delicious food cooked by mom, but it also had its own share of disadvantages. 
Gained around 10kgs. 
Though I limited my food intake and started exercising, what’s done is done.

- I had thought of tutoring final and pre final year students of CSE. 
Interacted with few, though they liked the idea but did not join.

- Huge spike in covid cases in April and May. 
I was really worried reading the news and social media posts. With Di's marriage ceremony round the corner, we had to cancel all the guests at the last moment. 
Had to do the ceremony with only 50 people, as per the protocol.

- Though there was definitely good news from the Olympics of India getting Gold, but also the Indian Cricket team lost the WTC as well as the T20 WC. 
The defeat made everyone upset.

- Trip to North East became very hectic at one point. 
Almost each of us got sick at some point.

## What did I learn?

I believe every moment in life is a learning experience. 
I have written below some of the learnings or skill which can be quantified.

- I learned to drive a car. 
Although I had gotten my license a couple of years back, I was always afraid of taking out the car in busy streets. 
With enough practice in the lockdown, now I can confidently drive in the city.

- I am learning to play guitar. 
It’s my second attempt and I plan not to quit this time.

- Learned the fundamentals of investment. 
This will surely help me in managing my money and making the right decision.

- Not everything goes the way as planned. 
Sometimes we need to make tough decisions or in other cases ask for help. 
But that’s what life is all about. 

Hoping the new year brings more happiness, success, love and blessings. Cheers!!
