      <description>What is an Abstract Class? An Abstract Class is the layout of the class. It defines several methods, some concrete and some abstract. The child class extending the abstract class needs to implement the abstract methods. It can also override the implementation of a concrete method.
Why use Abstract Class? An abstract class is used when we want to provide a common interface for different implementations. But those multiple implementations have some methods in common which can be defined in the base class itself and used by all.</description>

      <description>Reading is to the mind what exercise is to the body.
 This is a famous quote by Richard Steele and it is 100% accurate. Think of it as trying to hold water in a dirty sieve. The water will definitely flow out from the pores but if you do it repeatedly, it will surely clean the sieve. The same holds with reading. The dirty sieve here is your mind and holding water is reading.</description>
