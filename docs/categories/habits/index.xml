      <description>Reading is to the mind what exercise is to the body.
 This is a famous quote by Richard Steele and it is 100% accurate. Think of it as trying to hold water in a dirty sieve. The water will definitely flow out from the pores but if you do it repeatedly, it will surely clean the sieve. The same holds with reading. The dirty sieve here is your mind and holding water is reading.</description>
