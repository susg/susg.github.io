      <description>Hello there. This post is all about my introspection to how the last year went so that I can take the good things and learn from my mistakes, hence try to improve the upcoming year.
What went well this year?   I spent the entire year working from my hometown, Siliguri. Many of my school friends had also come home. Met them after a very long time. Remembered and cherished the good old times.</description>
